        We always associate success with money, which is a FLEX tape for all our problems, isn't it? Well, I object...
        <br> A man owns tens of villas across the country. The catch: his son died in a car crash; his life is becoming more miserable everytime the clock goes tiktok. He has all his riches... but can they replace his son? Similarly, if a painter earns a handsome amount but people don't appreciate her art, will she be satiated? The answer is NO!
        <br> Success is, therefore, not money; God affords all requisites even if we don't afford them (for luxury log on to Afterlife.) Instead, Success is the satisfaction that we have lived up to our "passion"; our passion is the panacea of each and every mental crisis. Success is the peace of mind and heart. Success is thr feeling that we will remain in people's hearts and minds- as we "helped" them through our passion- when our physical being is nothing but a heap of decomposed bones!
        <br> Take Stephen Hawking, for example, an immobile man. Although he had money, it couldn't help him. Yet he was happy, not because he had money, but he had lived for a glorious 76 years. He had a passion for cosmology, and his adherence to it produced results so brilliant, or dark (Black holes, get it?), that he lives and will live in the minds of people for many generations to come. He contributed to the world. In other words, He SUCCEEDED!
        <br> In conclusion, we should work hard for our passion. We should work hard in utilizing our passion for helping people. We should work hard to inspire and learn, but never, I say never, to earn...
