        Due to extensive air and light pollution, especially in Lahore, we had lost the wonderful glimpses of the "chunks of Heaven" in the vast, gargantuan sky.
        <br> But, we have been granted one more chance to save the art of stargazing. Yes, I am referring to one of the benifits that lockdown has brought us. (Not to mention the cancellation of board exams. PARTY HARD!!!... Alone LMAO!) 
        <br> The stars are fighting back! They have turned the tide against the artificial light and have yet again begun to fill our eyes with their charm and allure.
        <br> I'll quote my uncle here; he told me, "When we were your age, we could see the Milky Way galaxy! We would scuttle off to our roofs at night to see the awe-inspiring spectacle, especially in September, and sometimes even went to sleep while stargazing. Your grandparents had to kick us up and it hurt a lot, but it was worth it!"
        <br> Have to admit I was really jealous. I always wanted to follow the star-trails through the aperture of my camera's lens.
        <br> Well... the news that makes us frolic is, (DRUM ROLL) "The stars are back in business!" I really hope they continue spreading beauty everywhere succeeding lockdown and the end of these disastrous times. May the skies remain as starry as they are meant to be. (Amen)
        <br> Also , may all the sick be cured. (Amen)
        <br> Prayers be with you... Adios!
