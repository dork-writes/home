        "They (the believing women) should draw their head-coverings over their bosoms..."
        Surah Al-Nur (the Light) (24:31)
        <br>
        Marvi Sarmad... Well done! You have done so much for this country. You have been our national hero! Keep going against Islamic laws, and Allah will bestow you with women empowerment!
        So... here I will not talk about women's feminism (extremism) appeal. There are many sources you can cite for that matter. The sources of last year might be able to help too. Anyway, I am here to talk about, "Mera Jism Meri Marzi!"
        Well, first of all, I will reiterate Khaleel-ur-Rehman Qamar's reply to Mari Sari, "Tere Jism Mein he hi kya Ullu Ki Pathi!" (this is only for Mari Sari)
        OK....so you go against the laws of Islam... And you don't stop, you disrespect hijab, call it SHIT!??? Now you've done it, woman... NOW YOU HAVE DONE IT! You think Islam is clich√©,
        OK... I'll afford something else.
        You know... If women wear hijab, it protects them somewhat from being an object of sexual harassment, from men who have lustful motives?
        Until women stopped covering their heads and wearing head to toe clothes, mostly head to toe clothes, men never dared to look directly at them?
        Their hijab was and is a sign of dignity and honor. They were already empowered. 
        <br>...
        <br>--- Hijab is the determined veil between a man and a woman.
        <br>...
        <br> Back to "Mera jisam meri marzi":
        <br> And then they left clothing. Trying to attract attention, they started wearing sleeveless clothes, even came to be buck-naked. They enjoyed men noticing them; this proceeded like a chain reaction. Well then, rape cases began and women began to cry for their rights. So, I will ask you, do "men" hold all the responsibility for women being harassed and being deprived of equal rights, or women themselves have seen their rights off willfully too?
        I'm not against women, I am against the notion that the biggest problem in the world is "being a man"... and I do believe that lustful men (in extreme matters) and rapists should be stoned to death, if you do, in any way, feel that I am defending them.
