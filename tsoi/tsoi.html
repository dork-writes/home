        Hussain ibn e Ali(A.S), indeed, is the light of guidance and a message for all. In a battle against thousands of those who were devoid of Allah's fear, Hussain(A.S) sacrificed his beloved son, his brother, his nephews, and most of all, himself, for the preservation of Islam. For if it wasn't for him, Islam could not have lived through to this day. Only having the 72 legends able to fight, he provided an example of patience and bravery to all the lost ones. Even having starved for three days and deprived of his loved ones, he fought incredibly and showed that he alone, was enough for thousands of the wretched men. His family endured the pain that even the strongest of men, are fearful of. He, undoubtedly, is a colossal sign of patience and salvation. Labaik Ya Hussain(A.S)
